Project Title: Face Shape Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop an automated system that classifies human face shapes from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model identifies face shapes such as oval, round, square, heart, or diamond. This classification can be useful in applications like personalized fashion recommendations, hairstyle suggestions, or cosmetic consultations.

Problem Statement:
Human face shape plays a crucial role in various fields, including fashion and beauty. Manually determining the face shape can be subjective and prone to error. Therefore, this project aims to create an automated, accurate, and reliable system to identify face shapes from images using deep learning techniques.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Dataset:

The dataset consists of labeled images of human faces, each categorized by shape.
The dataset was divided into training and validation sets using an 80-20 split.
Image Preprocessing:

Images were resized to a fixed dimension of 180x180 pixels for uniformity.
Pixel values were normalized (rescaled) to improve model convergence.
Augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, and horizontal flipping were used to enhance model generalization.
Model Architecture:
The CNN model was developed using TensorFlow and Keras with the following architecture:

Input Layer:

The input layer receives images of size 180x180x3 (RGB).
Convolutional Layers:

Multiple convolutional layers with filters of sizes 32, 64, and 128.
Activation function: ReLU
Kernel size: 3x3
Pooling Layers:

Applied MaxPooling2D after each convolutional layer to reduce spatial dimensions.
Pool size: 2x2
Dropout Layer:

Used dropout layers with a dropout rate of 0.5 to prevent overfitting.
Flatten Layer:

Converts the 2D matrix to a 1D vector for fully connected layers.
Dense Layers:

Fully connected dense layers with activation function ReLU.
Output layer with Softmax activation to predict the probability distribution across multiple face shape classes.
Optimizer and Loss Function:

Optimizer: Adam
Loss function: Categorical Crossentropy
Model Training and Validation:
The model was trained on the training set with 20% of the data reserved for validation.
Batch size: 32
Number of epochs: 20
Used early stopping to prevent overfitting and model checkpointing to save the best model.
Performance Evaluation:
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Visualization:
Confusion Matrix: To observe true positive and false positive rates.
Classification Report: To evaluate the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
Accuracy and Loss Curves: To track the model's performance during training and validation.
Challenges Faced and Solutions:
Overfitting:

Applied dropout and data augmentation to improve model generalization.
Class Imbalance:

Addressed by data augmentation to generate more samples for minority classes.
Performance Tuning:

Experimented with different optimizers, dropout rates, and CNN architectures to optimize accuracy.
